<p>This helps eliminate a lot of the tedious, boilerplate code that machine learning researchers have to write when creating vision-based ML models. Additionally, they allow you to create new ML models based on the dataset you want, and export that trained ML model in a variety of formats. This also allows for developers without extensive ML experience to get started with making trained models without having to write the code for training a new model from scratch.</p>
