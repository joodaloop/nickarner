      <description>Delay Tracker was built to educate Amtrak passengers experiencing delays on their trip why those delays may be occuring, and to give them the opportunity to report the fact that their train was delayed to the Surface Transportation Board.
This way, the Amtrak-riding public could both become educated about hte challenges to the nation&amp;rsquo;s rail infrastructure, as well as have a way to ensure their complaints about their trip were heard.</description>

      <description>In 2017, I worked on a project where I built a circuit that emulated the Touché circuit from Disney Research.
I wanted to see if, using the circuit and machine-learning software, I could replicate the results of the Touché paper by training a system to detect how I was touching various plants, or how to use water as an interface.
I wrote about these experiments in Touché, and Water as an Interface, and Talking to Plants: Touché Experiments.</description>

      <description>I was of 80 developers worldwide to be accepted into Google&amp;rsquo;s Project Soli Alpha Developer Program and was one of 14 Alpha Developers to be invited to Google HQ to workshop new ideas regarding potential applications using SOLI.
My work involved investigating Soli&amp;rsquo;s potential use in new musical instruments with Paul Batchelor; who wrote the sound synthesis language that powered the instruments. Some of this work was shown in in this video presented by ATAP at Google I/O 2016:</description>

      <description>Through December 2019 to Feburary 2020, Julie Young and I worked together on a push-to-talk audio chat app; Julie designed the app, and I built it. The app let people create audio channels that would be broadcast to others in a nearby physical location.
Users could see available nearby channels and join them. Using the push-to-talk interface, they could talk to the channel.
Creating Audio Channels
We used the OpenTok (now known as the Vonage Video API) SDK for audio channel creation and communciation.</description>

      <description>with Matt Becker and Tana Green
Whistlr was an app for sharing your contact information with acquaintances, colleagues at a conference, or the person you just met at the coffeeshop.
The app would create your contact profile by pulling in your contact card information from the iOS Contacts App. Once you had done that, you could share your contact card with othter people nearby who had Whistlr open. For security, whenever a contact card was sent, a three-digit code was generated.</description>
