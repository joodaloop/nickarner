<h1>Freelancing Tactics</h1>
      <div class=date>Published on Apr 3, 2024 </div>
      <p>Wanted to share some thoughts on lessons learned from doing freelance for the past few years. Several of these are lessons I’ve learned the hard way - which is sometimes the only way to learn a lesson.</p>
<p><strong>Before Starting Work</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Always</em> get a contract signed - this protects both you and the client.</li>
<li>Make sure to add in a clause to any contracts to late fees for your invoices. If a client is late to paying an invoice, add a late fee as some percentage of the amount owed.</li>
<li>If doing project-based work, make sure it is very clearly defined in scope. There should be no ambiguity between either party on what the scope of the work to be completed is.
<ul>
<li>If all parties act in good faith, and a project evolves in scope out of unforeseen necessities, you should communicate with them about the additional work required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your time is valuable, and you should treat it as such.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Communication and Expectations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Over communicate; especially if you’re working fully remote</li>
<li>Depending on the specific nature or engagement, having weekly check-in for status updates with whomever is the directly responsible individual of your client is a good idea.</li>
<li>If a project is not working out for whatever reason, find a way to wrap your work gracefully and give your notice.</li>
<li>Document what you do
<ul>
<li>Notes</li>
<li>Screenshots</li>
<li>Screen recordings</li>
<li>These are helpful both for your own records, and also as material for writing progress reports. I usually write some kind of progress report after certain milestones are hit and send them to the client.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Taxes and Finance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Set aside enough money for taxes. Self-employed individuals have to file taxes quarterly; so be sure to have enough set aside for when these roll around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep track of your expenses. Even small ones can add up after a while, and can help minimize your tax bill.</p>
<ul>
<li>Transportation</li>
<li>Coffee / meal meetings</li>
<li>Software</li>
<li>Phone/computer/other equipment</li>
<li>Rent (if you work from home, you can <a href="https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/small-business-taxes/the-home-office-deduction/L1RZyYxzv" target="_blank" class="external-link" >deduct part of your space</a>)</li>
<li>Domain names</li>
<li>WiFi</li>
<li>Continuing education expenses
<ul>
<li>Books</li>
<li>Classes</li>
<li>Workshops</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
