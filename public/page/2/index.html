					<span class="description">
						
						As I mentioned in a previous post, I was really pleased to see that the ESP-Sensors project had included code for working with a circuit based on Touché.
I had earlier come across other implementations of Touché for the Arduino, but unlike the ESP project, none of them utilized machine learning for classifying gesture types.
Touché is a project developed at Disney Research that uses swept-frequency capacitive sensing to &ldquo;&hellip;not only detect a touch event, but simultaneously recognize complex configurations of the human hands and body during touch interaction.&hellip;

					<span class="description">
						
						The past several years have seen an explosion in machine learning, including in creative contexts - everything fromhallucinating puppyslugs, togenerating new melodies, machine learning is already beginning to revolutionize the way artists and musicians execute their craft.
My personal interest in the area of machine learning relates to using it to recognize human gestural input via sensors. This interest was sparked from working with Project Soli as a member of the Alpha Developer program.&hellip;

						I&rsquo;m writing this having returned from the 2016 EYEO Festival, a gathering of creative technologists, designers, and artists from all over the world. It was an amazing experience, and I highly recommend going if you ever have the chance to do so. There were many things I enjoyed about it&hellip;the excellent talks, getting to meet people I&rsquo;ve only talked to on Twitter for the first time, and the late night dancing at Prince&rsquo;s nightclub.&hellip;

					<span class="description">
						
						Last year, Google announced that they would be accepting accepting applications from developers to be part of the Project SOLI Alpha Developer program. My friend Paul Batchelor and I were one of 80 total developers selected worldwide to be part of the Alpha program. Our work focuses on the use of SOLI in interactive music.
We were selected to attend a workshop in Mountain View with other Alpha developers, and members of the SOLI team.&hellip;
