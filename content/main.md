Nick has been working in the human-comptuer interaction field since 2014, when he was working as a researcher/prototyper
for mobile augmented-reality apps at AirMarkr, an early mobile augmented reality startup when consumer AR was in its nascence.

He continued to work as an iOS developer at both product focused and consulting companies, where he collaborated with product
managers and designers to prototype concepts and produced production-ready features.

Nick was also selected to be a member of Google ATAP's Project Soli Alpha Developer program, where he was invited to test the
millimeter-wave radar development kit that Google had produced. This program included selection to attend a development workshop
with the ATAP team, as well as inclusion of his work in a video shown at Google I/O. Driven by an interest in radar’s use as an
interaction modality, he co-wrote a paper on this work, which was presented at NIME 2016.

During this time, Nick actively involved himself in the startup space and provided extensive consulting for Asteroid
Technologies. He then joined full-time as its first employee, prompting him to relocate to San Francisco. He contributed to
developing a node-based interface tool for creating AR interactions that used sensor-input and machine learning to drive
interactions. The tool allowed users the ability to create ARKit-based apps without writing any code. Nick also researched and
prototyped AR-focused features and experiments around a variety of modalities, including audio and voice, haptics, gestures, and
controllers.

Nick is currently freelancing and consulting for early stage startups in the consumer/social and healthcare spaces.
