Last night I went to the Designing for AI event at Notion hosted by [Linus Lee](https://thesephist.com). The panelists were [Ryo Lu](https://twitter.com/ryolu_) (Design Lead at Notion), [Amelia Wattenberger](https://twitter.com/Wattenberger) (Designer at Adept), [Omar Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omarlee/) (VP, Product Design at Slack), and [Adam Storr](https://twitter.com/AdamStorr) (Head of Design at Hex).

Wrote up some notes from the event: 

* How the panelists described their companies' useage of AI: 

  * Slack - "Trying to make it so you get more of the signal and less of the noise in your communications"

  * Adept - "Make it easier to use your computer"

  * Hex - "Ask any questions about your data"
  * Notion: "One system with a variety of building blocks...how can we make AI fit into any building block?"

* Metaphors for building with AI: 

  * Agents

  * Copilots

  * Tool

  * Medium

* Eventually AI will be in everything, and it won't be a big deal at all
  * No one ever designs a product and worries about explaining what a database is to a user

* Give the user the ability to change how much control they want to exert on the fly

* AI is a primitive, but it should fit into all other primitives 

* The floor is chat
  	* It does not offer any affordances
  	* Text is an imprecise medium

* Adept design team all writes code; "You can only get so far in Figma"

* You have to design within the existing constraints of what AI can do, but be midnful of possible future changes

* Everything an LLM says is a hallucination - "they are dream machines"

* Figure out how to maintain consistency when UI can be generated or personalized

* Most users shouldn't ever learn how to prompt or worry about what to enter into a blank text box
