<i>Interfaces + Invention + Investing.<br>Computers are great but they could be better.</i>

I'm a developer and researcher working in the field of Human-Computer Interaction.  I live and work in San Francisco, California. 

You can explore a variety of projects I've contributed to—spanning work assignments, open-source contributions, freelance gigs, and personal endeavors—on my [Projects](/projects_and_work) page.

## Now

I'm currently [working with a couple folks on an iPad app for Designers](https://twitter.com/adammenges/status/1699093455371477343?s=20) called [Stitch](https://stitchdesign.app). We'll be rolling out TestFlight access soon.

I also [angel invest](/investing), and am particularly interested in startups reimagining the way we interact with computers.



## Site

This site is home to my [Notes](/notes) on HCI, new technologies, and software development. Published work can be found here. I also maintain a list of books that I've found important in my work on the [Books](/books) page.

Pages are served by Render, and hosted on Github. I use Hugo to generate the site itself, and use a custom theme developed by [Judah](https://webcraft.joodaloop.com).
