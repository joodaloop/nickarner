<i>Interfaces + Invention + Investing.<br>Computers are great but they could be better.</i>

![Nick](/headshot.jpg "l-float") 

I'm a developer and researcher working in the field of Human-Computer Interaction.  I live and work in San Francisco, California. 

I've written a lot of software for work, open-source projects, freelance and personal projects. You can check out some of the stuff I've worked on on the [Projects](/projects_and_work) page.
