I built the first version of Pocket, an iOS chat app for [Urbit](https://urbit.org). I contracted for [Tlon Corp](http://tlon.io) to build their vision of a mobile-first way to use the Urbit network. 

Urbit is a reimagining of what an OS can be; built around the concept of a peer-to-peer network. Users have "ships" that can talk to each other in a federated manner. Previously, the most common way for users to do this was through a web-based product called [Landscape](https://urbit.org/blog/landscape-a-portrait). 

The Pocket app allowed users to sign-in to their ships and load all of ther DMs and group chats. They could also create new DMs and group chats with people they were in shared groups with.
