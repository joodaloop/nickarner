[Meter](http://meter.com/) is a company that develops IT hardware and software for network infrastructure, catering to environments such as schools, warehouses, and offices. I worked wtih them to build a native MacOS app that allows their customers to access their VPN with a simple and friendly user experience. 

It's built in Swift, and utilizes the Network Extension framework for creating a VPN connection.

The app is available on the App Store.
