Delay Tracker was the first iOS app I built, aimed at enabling Amtrak travelers facing train delays to report them to the [Surface Transportation Board](https://www.stb.gov), the federal entity responsible for regulating the nation's railroads. 

The app served a dual purpose: educating Amtrak passengers about the potential reasons behind the delays they were experiencing, and providing a channel to report these delays to the Surface Transportation Board. This initiative not only fostered awareness regarding the challenges faced by the nation's rail infrastructure but also empowered travelers to voice their concerns and ensure their grievances were acknowledged.

Delay Tracker was written in Objective-C, with the interface designed by [Tana Green](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanagreen/).
