[Julie Young](https://twitter.com/juliey4) and I collaborated on the development of a local peer-to-peer, push-to-talk audio chat app designed for real-time communication within proximate geographic locations.  The app was tailored to facilitate instant audio interactions in scenarios such as production sets, construction sites, and similar environments where immediate communication is crucial.

The core functionality allowed users to create and join audio channels based on their relative geographic proximity. The channels were visible to individuals within the designated area, who could effortlessly join any available channel. Utilizing the push-to-talk interface, users could seamlessly communicate with others in the channel, thus promoting real-time, on-site collaboration and coordination.

Whistlr was an application designed to facilitate the exchange of contact cards between individuals through audio signals, reminiscent of the [Bump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bump_(application)) app, but utilizing audio instead. It employed the [ChirpSDK](https://github.com/chirp) to enable data transmission via audio tones, essentially creating an audio QR code.

[Whistlr](https://twitter.com/WhistlrApp) catered to individuals looking to share contact details with new acquaintances, colleagues at events, or casual meetups at cafes. The app streamlined the creation of your contact profile by importing your contact card information from the iOS Contacts App. Once set up, you could share your contact card with others in proximity who had Whistlr open. To bolster security, a three-digit code was generated each time a contact card was shared. The intended recipient would input this code to receive and save the sender's contact card in their Contacts app.

It was powered  by [Chirp](http://chirp.io/)â€™s data over sound technology; letting you easily and securely share contact information with those around you. (Note: [Chirp has since been acquired by Sonos](https://audioxpress.com/news/data-over-sound-pioneer-chirp-acquired-by-sonos), and their developer site is no longer active.)

This is the [post](https://medium.com/@narner/announcing-whistlr-for-ios-15a715b7706b) we shared to announce it.
