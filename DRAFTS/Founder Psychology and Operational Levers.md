I’ve worked with several startups as an employee, contractor, and investor; and have been able to see how founders often approach the evers of cash, equity, and control when negotiating with a potential hire.

In my experience, founders are generally always stingy about one of three things - cash, equity, and control. The ratio at which a particular founder can be stingy can evolve over the course of their startup. 

This is not a judgment on founders at all; far from it. However, they are things that founders should be aware of when running their startups. 

The three things of which a founder can be stingy are:

- Cash
- Equity
- Control

In very early stages, if a founder has raised no money or a very small amount of money, they, logically, will be most likely to be more mindful of how much cash they spend; particularly when hiring. Given that they have a large amount of equity, but little cash; they will be more likely to be willing to give out larger equity grants to prospective hires than cash-heavy ones. 

In a startup that’s in the latter stages (that has found product-market fit and had several successful financing rounds, at which the founding team has been able to take money off the table), founders will have much higher cash reserves at their disposal for hires or other expenses. This is not to say that they may not be frugal (an admirable trait in most situations), but that they are more willing to burn through cash in order to grow their startup as fast as possible. 

The last area at which a founder can be stingy is control. Many founders start their own companies precisely *because* they want to have a sense of control over their own careers and destinies. This is obviously something that should be encouraged at every level. 

However, this can get in the way of founders learning how to *delegate* effectively. If founders are never willing to give up *some* authority to those who are working for them, those people will not be able to do their jobs effectively; stymying the growth of the startup. 

Equity, cash, and control are all levers that founders can use to grow their startup. There will be times when founders will (and should) be stingy on one or more of these things. However, it’s important for them to be mindful of which of these they are most *naturally* disposed to being, so that they do not go too far when the situation may call for being more, not less generous with one of the three.
