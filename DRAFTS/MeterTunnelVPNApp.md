[Meter](http://meter.com) is a company that develops IT hardware and software for network infrastructure, catering to environments such as schools, warehouses, and offices. While they previously offered a VPN service through WireGuard, they are now focused on enhancing the user experience for VPN connectivity.

I worked wtih them to build a MacOS app that would allow their customers to access their VPN with a simple and friendly user experience. 





The app would also provide network packet and WiFI statistic information to the user. 





The app's available for download on the App Store here, but, you have to be an existing Meter customer to use it.
