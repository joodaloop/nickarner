***I think I have a slightly unconventional path to angel investing  I started advising & helping my friends & referrals in a fractional capacity to realize some of them are gems I wanted to invest in Didn’t see much material on it so here a post about my unique experience & why I advocate more people should try it. Some lessons/observations : Make that your own wordsAlso within Culture & product I’d put sub sections as : What I decided to invest. What I did not***









I'm still relatively early in my investing journey. That said, having been able to work with a variety of teams across different sectors has given me some insight into what to try to look for when assessing how companies operate. 

Being “on the ground” working with a team at a startup is, of course, a very different perspective from that of an investor hearing a pitch from a startup’s founder(s). While investors do of course look for the ability of a startup to execute on the vision of the founders, they don’t always get a first-hand look at how the companies operate on the ground 

Freelancing and investing have collided in mutually helpful ways for me. For example, I’m able to find and reach talented people in their early days and offer hands-on support. A few years ago, I did a small consulting project for [Kishan Bagaria ](http://kishanbagaria.com/)for [Texts.com](http://texts.com/) thanks to a Twitter interaction. That led me to be able to build a relationship with him and his company. This put me in a position to be able to invest in Texts twice before their acquisition by Automattic. 

It’s also worked in the opposite direction; where as an investor, I’ve been able to help later stage founders explore new projects. For example, I worked with [Joseph Nelson](https://josephofiowa.com/) of [Roboflow](http://roboflow.com/) to develop an [iOS SDK for them](https://blog.roboflow.com/roboflow-ios-sdk/). 

I’ve been lucky to work with lots of different teams while freelancing, from pre-seed to Series B stage startups. I’ve gotten to see up close how these teams work and how the founders operate their companies. I’ve gotten to work with startups in many different sectors, from computer vision dev tools to fintech to hardware infrastructure to crypto. I’ve learned a lot about what to look for when assessing how founders think about culture and product:

**Culture**

- Bias for action is important
- A sense of urgency is good; a sense of panic is toxic
- There’s a huge difference between moving fast and thrashing about in panic. Good engineering leaders will protect their teams from external stresses from other stakeholders so that they can do their best work.
- A culture of ownership enables project leaders to shepherd a project to completiono

**Product**

- Each project should have one person who’s in charge; the “champion” of the project. If not, projects will flounder or not get finished. 
- Often, projects will begin at the direction of the Founder/CEO. At a certain point, they will then hand the project to a senior employee or engineering manager of some kind. 
- Too many cooks make a bad meal. If everyone on a team has a say or direct input on a project, it will stall at best, or produce mediocre results at worst. 
  - Projects should have one person who is ultimately in charge. This is not to say that input should be discouraged; by no means. But, great results come from taste and opinion rather than group consensus. 

I’d encourage founders to consider having people that help them out on a freelance/fractional basis on their cap-table, and for freelancers to consider investing in the clients they work with. This can foster a mutually beneficial relationship between the founder and freelancer over the course of a startup.
