Wanted to share some thoughts on lessons learned from doing freelance for the past few years. Several of these are lessons I’ve learned the hard way - which is sometimes the only way to learn a lesson. 

**Before Starting Work**

- Always get a contract signed - this protects both you and the client 
- Make sure to add in a clause to any contracts to late fees for your invoices. If a client is late to paying an invoice, add a late fee as some percentage of the amount owed. 
- If doing project-based work, make sure it is very clearly defined in scope. There should be no ambiguity between either party on what the scope of the work to be completed is. 
  - If all parties act in good faith, and a project evolves in scope out of unforeseen necessities, you should communicate with them about the need
- Your time is valuable, and you should treat it as such. 

**Communication and Expectations**

- Over communicate; especially if you’re working fully remote 
- Depending on the specific nature or engagement, having weekly check-in for status updates with whomever is the directly responsible individual of your client is a good idea. 
- If a project is not working out for whatever reason, find a way to wrap your work gracefully and give your notice. 
- Document what you do 
  - Notes
  - Screenshots 
  - Screen recordings
  - These are helpful both for your own records, and also as material for writing progress reports. I usually write some kind of progress report after certain milestones are hit and send them to the client. 

**Taxes and Finance**

- Set aside enough money for taxes. Self - employed individuals have to file taxes quarterly; so be sure to have enough set aside for when these roll around. 

- Keep track of your expenses. Even small ones can add up after a while, and can help minimize your tax bill.
